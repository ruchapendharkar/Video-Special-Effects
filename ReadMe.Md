# Video Special Effects 

## Created by Rucha Pendharkar on 1/31/24

The purpose of this project is to getting familiarized with C++/OpenCV. It deals with the mechanics of capturing and manipulation of images and video streams. The tasks involved implementing various pre-existing filters, using OpenCV functions or writing custom ones.


## Features

- **Greyscale Mode:** Toggle between regular greyscale and a custom implementation.
- **Sepia Mode:** Apply a sepia tone to the video stream.
- **Blur Mode:** Use a 5x5 blur filter for a smoother appearance.
- **SobelX and SobelY Modes:** Apply Sobel filters for edge detection in the X and Y directions.
- **Magnitude Mode:** Calculate and display the gradient magnitude of the video.
- **Blur Quantize Mode:** Apply a blur and quantize effect to the video.
- **Face Detection Mode:** Detect faces in the video stream and draw rectangles around them.
- **Negative Mode:** Invert the colors of the video.
- **Blur Faces Mode:** Blur the regions outside of detected faces.
- **Sparkles Mode:** Add sparkles to strong edges detected in the video.
- **Sketch Mode:** Convert the video into a pencil sketch.


## Usage

- Press 'q' to exit the application.
- Press 's' to save the current frame as an image.
- Toggle between different modes using the corresponding keys ('g' for greyscale, 'p' for sepia, etc.).

## Environment 
The scripts were authored using VS Code, and code compilation took place in the Ubuntu 20.04.06 LTS environment, utilizing CMake through the terminal.
